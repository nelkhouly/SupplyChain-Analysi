# **Supply Chain Visibility and Risk Management**

## **Overview**
This project aims to enhance supply chain visibility by analyzing logistical risks and inefficiencies. It uses predictive models to identify late delivery risks and flag operational disruptions, helping stakeholders make informed decisions and improve overall supply chain performance.

## **Features**
- Predict **late delivery risks** using machine learning models.
- Flag **logistical inefficiencies** based on profit ratio and order quantity.
- Analyze **order statuses** to identify potential disruptions.
- Models used: **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes.**

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)**, titled "DataCoSupplyChainDataset." It includes information on orders, logistics, and delivery performance.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed delivery statuses and identified trends in late deliveries.
- Created flags for inefficiencies and disruptions based on shipping data and order metrics.
- Highlighted patterns related to **logistics inefficiencies** and **delivery delays.**

## **Machine Learning Results**
| Model              | Accuracy  |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Random Forest       | 99.47%    |
| Gradient Boosting   | 98.67%    |
| Decision Tree       | 99.49%    |
| Naive Bayes         | 61.28%    |
